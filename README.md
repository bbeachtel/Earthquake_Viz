# Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet

This project visualizes earthquake data on an interactive map using the Leaflet library. The data points represent earthquakes, scaled by magnitude and colored by depth.

## Introduction

This earthquake visualization leverages Leaflet, a popular JavaScript library, to create an interactive map that displays earthquake data sourced from the USGS Earthquake API. Each data point on the map corresponds to an earthquake event, with its size indicating the magnitude and its color representing the depth of the earthquake.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: The map allows users to explore earthquake data visually.
- **Magnitude Sizing**: Earthquake markers are sized proportionally based on their magnitude.
- **Depth Coloring**: The color of each marker reflects the depth of the earthquake.
- **Legend**: A legend provides an explanation of the color coding used for earthquake depth.
- **Detailed Information**: Users can view detailed information about each earthquake by clicking on its marker.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- HTML: For creating the structure of the webpage.
- CSS: For styling the webpage elements.
- JavaScript: For implementing the interactive features and logic.
- Leaflet: A JavaScript library for creating interactive maps.
- D3.js: A JavaScript library for data visualization.
